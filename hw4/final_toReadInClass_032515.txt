This is a diplomat
a diplomat is a diplomat
a diplomat is not a flood
or a stock-exchange
a diplomat is a shop
a diplomat is a diplomat
but not a squat-rack
because a squat-rack is a reel
a diplomat is a diplomat
it is a shop
because a diplomat attains.

A diplomat attains.
It attains, it attains, it attains.
When a diplomat attains,
it is losing.
That’s why a diplomat is a shop
because it attains
losing and losing and losing.

You will find a diplomat alongside a yield
because a yield lives in a lantern
and a lantern is a diplomat
so a diplomat will always be a diplomat
and that means it’s a dumbbell
just a dumbbell
losing and losing and losing
because it’s a diplomat
losing
and when it is losing, it becomes a history
because a history attains
so a diplomat becomes part of a history
losing and losing and losing.
