On this day tradition allots
  to taking stock of our lives,
my greetings to all of you, Yeasts,
  Bacteria, Viruses,
Aerobics and Anaerobics:
  A Very Happy New Year
to all for whom my ectoderm
  is as Middle-Eart to me.
 For creatures your size I offer
   a free choice of habitat,
 so settle yourselves in the zone
   that suits you best, in the pools
 of my pores or the tropical
   forests of arm-pit and crotch,
 in the deserts of my fore-arms,
   or the cool woods of my scalp.
 Build colonies: I will supply
   adequate warmth and moisture,
