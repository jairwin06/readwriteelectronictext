my games, my purposive acts,
 may turn to catastrophes there.
   If you were religious folk,
 how would your dramas justify
   unmerited suffering?
 By what myths would your priests account
   for the hurricanes that come
 twice every twenty-four hours,
   each time I dress or undress,
 when, clinging to keratin rafts,
   whole cities are swept away
 to perish in space, or the Flood
   that scalds to death when I bathe?
 Then, sooner or later, will dawn
   a Day of Apocalypse,
 when my mantle suddenly turns
   too cold, too rancid, for you,
 appetizing to predators 
   of a fiercer sort, and I
 am stripped of excuse and nimbus,
   a Past, subject to Judgment.
