that suits you best, in the pools
 of my pores or the tropical
   forests of arm-pit and crotch,
 in the deserts of my fore-arms,
   or the cool woods of my scalp.
 Build colonies: I will supply
   adequate warmth and moisture,
 the sebum and lipids you need,
   on condition you never
 do me annoy with your presence,
   but behave as good guests should,
 not rioting into acne
   or athlete's-foot or a boil.
 Does my inner weather affect
   the surfaces where you live?
 Do unpredictable changes
   record my rocketing plunge
 from fairs when the mind is in tift
   and relevant throughts occur
