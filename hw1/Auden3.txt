or athlete's-foot or a boil.
 Does my inner weather affect
   the surfaces where you live?
 Do unpredictable changes
   record my rocketing plunge
 from fairs when the mind is in tift
   and relevant throughts occur
 to fouls when nothing will happen
   and no one calls and it rains.
 I should like to think that I make
   a not impossible world,
 but an Eden it cannot be:
   my games, my purposive acts,
 may turn to catastrophes there.
   If you were religious folk,
 how would your dramas justify
   unmerited suffering?
 By what myths would your priests account
   for the hurricanes that come
