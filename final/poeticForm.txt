This is a subject 
a subject is a subject
a subject is not a one 
or a two 
a subject is a three 
a subject is a subject 
but not a four  
because a four is a five 
a subject is a subject 
it is a three 
because a subject verb.

A subject verb.
It verb, it verb, it verb.
When a subject verb,
it is gerund.
That is why a subject is a three
because it verb
gerund and gerund and gerund.

You will find a subject alongside a six
because a six lives in a seven
and a seven is a subject
so a subject will always be a subject
and that means it is a eight
just a eight
gerund and gerund and gerund
because it is a subject
gerund
and when it is gerund, it becomes a nine
because a nine verb
so a subject becomes part of a nine
gerund and gerund and gerund.
